			participating in the 100 Days of Code challenge with the goal that this becomes a regular part of my routine.</p>

			<p class="blogTitle">100 Days of Code: Day 1 - GitHub</p>
			<p class="blogDate">3/25/2018</p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">Today was my first day of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I’m taking this challenge as a way to 
			stay accountable in my quest for daily learning habits. I’d like to spend at least one hour a day coding or learning something 
			new. My focus for day 1 of 100 days of code was Github. I’d like to use Github for many things, but my main focus for now was 
			setting up my portfolio website.</p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">So, what is GitHub? Before today, I was not so sure. With the many resources online, I found that 
			Github is actually pretty cool. It acts as a social network for developers. We upload our projects to Github and anyone can see 
			our code and suggest changes be made to it. It can be a very effective collaboration tool. Git is version control software and 
			allows for multiple users to work on a project at once without losing important code to changes made by someone else. 
			Every change to the project is saved and can be reverted back.</p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">With the help of a Readwrite.com article called <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/">"GitHub for Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started",</a> 
			I was able to upload my website utilizing Git on the command line.</p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">With the help of Tyler Fisher's article titled, <a href="https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328">"Steps for Hosting a Website on Github"</a>, I was able to make the site live on the 
			Github platform, just like a hosting provider. The key in doing this was naming the repository username.github.io, where 
			username is your github username. </p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">One problem I did have was getting my .php contact form to work. Github allows for one static website, 
			but it does not support php or any other server side languages. So, what to do? A helpful user on Stack Overflow suggested 
			<a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a> for contact forms on static sites. Let me tell you, Formspree is such an easy to 
			implement solution to my problem. It works great and is free! Definitely recommend!</p>
			<p class="blogParagraph">My trophy for today is a deployed website on taylerjohannes.github.io</a></p>
